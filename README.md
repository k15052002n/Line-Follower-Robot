# Line-Follower-Robot
A line follower robot uses sensors to detect and follow a specific path, usually a line marked on the ground. By utilizing infrared sensors to differentiate between the line and the surface, the robot autonomously adjusts its movement to stay on track. It's commonly used for automation, navigation, and educational purposes.
